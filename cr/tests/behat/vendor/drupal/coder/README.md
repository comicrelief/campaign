# Coder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/klausi/coder.svg?branch=8.x-2.x)](https://travis-ci.org/klausi/coder)

Coder is a library for automated Drupal code reviews and coding standard fixes. It
defines rules for [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)

Built-in support for:
- "Drupal": Coding Standards https://www.drupal.org/coding-standards
- "DrupalPractice": Best practices for Drupal module development

Online documentation: https://www.drupal.org/node/1419980

Note that Javascript support has been removed. To check and fix Javascript files
please use [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) and see the
[Drupal ESLint](https://www.drupal.org/node/1955232) documentation.


## Installation

First, make sure Composer is installed correctly:
```
which composer
```

If you get composer not found or similar, follow Composer's installation
instructions.

Install Coder (8.x-2.x) in your global Composer directory in your home directory
(~/.composer):
```
composer global require drupal/coder
```

To make the phpcs and phpcbf commands available globally, add the composer bin path
to your $PATH variable in ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
```
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"
```

Register the Drupal and DrupalPractice Standard with PHPCS:
```
phpcs --config-set installed_paths ~/.composer/vendor/drupal/coder/coder_sniffer
```


## Usage

Check Drupal coding standards
```
phpcs --standard=Drupal --extensions=php,module,inc,install,test,profile,theme /file/to/drupal/example_module
```

Check Drupal best practices
```
phpcs --standard=DrupalPractice --extensions=php,module,inc,install,test,profile,theme /file/to/drupal/example_module
```

Automatically fix coding standards
```
phpcbf --standard=Drupal --extensions=php,module,inc,install,test,profile,theme /file/to/drupal/example_module
```


## Working with Editors

## Automated Testing (PHPUnit + PHPCS)

Coder Sniffer comes with a PHPUnit test suite to make sure the sniffs work correctly.
Use Composer to install the dependencies:

```
composer install
```

Then execute the tests:
```
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Then execute the coding standards checker on Coder itself:
```
./vendor/bin/phpcs
```
