fDOMDocument
============

The classes contained within this repository extend the standard DOM to use exceptions at
all occasions of errors instead of PHP warnings or notices. They also add various custom methods
and shortcuts for convenience and to simplify the usage of DOM.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theseer/fDOMDocument.png)](https://travis-ci.org/theseer/fDOMDocument)


Requirements
------------

    PHP: 5.3.3 (5.3.0-5.3.2 had serious issues with spl stacked autoloaders)
    Extensions: dom, libxml


Installation
------------
Apart from cloning this repository, fDOMDocument can be installed using by any of the following methods.

#####Composer
As fDOMDocument is a library and does not provide any cli tools, you can only add it to your own project:

    {
        "require": {
            "theseer/fdomdocument": "1.6.*"
        }
    }

#####PEAR
The following two commands are all that is required to install fDOMDocument using the PEAR Installer:

    sudo pear channel-discover pear.netpirates.net
    sudo pear install TheSeer/fDOMDocument

After the installation you can find the source files inside your local PEAR directory; the path is usually either
``/usr/share/pear/TheSeer/fDOMDocument`` (Fedora/Redhat) or ``/usr/lib/php/TheSeer/fDOMDocument`` (Debian/Ubuntu).

#####YUM (Fedora / Redhat / CentOS)
The following command will install fDOMDocument via its RPM package:

    sudo yum install php-theseer-fDOMDocument


Usage
-----

Simply require/include the autoload.php supplied and you can start using fDOMDocument as a
drop in replacement for DOMDocument.

Usage Samples
-------------
    <?php

    require 'TheSeer/fDOMDocument/autoload.php';

    $dom = new TheSeer\fDOM\fDOMDocument();
    try {
        $dom->loadXML('<?xml version="1.0" ?><root><child name="foo" /></root>');
    } catch (fDOMException $e) {
        die($e);
    }

    $child = $dom->queryOne('//child');
    print_r($child->getAttribute('name'));
    print_r($child->getAttribute('missing','DefaultValue'));

    ?>
