OilyPNG is a Ruby C extension to speed up the pure Ruby ChunkyPNG library. It is a standalone
module, so it does not require LibPNG, ImageMagick or any other library. Currently it has an 
alternative implementation of decoding and encoding PNGs, making these operations much 
faster, especially for PNG images that apply filtering.

*Warning*: this is my first C code in years. It may blow up your PC after leaking memory all
over the place, killing a kitten in the process. You have been warned.

== Usage

1. First install the gem and make it available to your project.
2. Use require "oily_png" instead of require "chunky_png"
3. Presto! Now use ChunkyPNG as you normally would and get an instant speedup. 

See http://github.com/wvanbergen/chunky_png/wiki for more information on how to use the
ChunkyPNG API.
