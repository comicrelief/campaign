# Guard::Compass
#
# You don't need to configure watchers for guard 'compass' declaration as they generated
# from your Compass configuration file. You might need to define the Compass working directory
# and point to the configuration file depending of your project structure.
#
# Available options:
#
# * working_directory: Define the Compass working directory, relative to the Guardfile directory
# * configuration_file: Path to the Compass configuration file, relative to :project_path
#
# Like usual, the Compass configuration path are relative to the :project_path

# guard 'compass', project_path: 'not_current_dir', configuration_file: 'path/to/my/compass_config.rb'
guard :compass
