# This is an example configuration provided by Wraith.

# This particular config is intended to demonstrate how
# to use Wraith in 'capture' mode, which is best suited to
# comparing a test and live version of the same website.
#
# `wraith capture capture.yaml`

# (required) The engine to run Wraith with. Examples: 'phantomjs', 'casperjs', 'slimerjs'
browser: "phantomjs"

# (required) The domains to take screenshots of.
domains:
  current:  "http://plat12-cr-campaign.pantheon.io"
  new:      "http://campaign.local"

# (required) The paths to capture. All paths should exist for both of the domains specified above.
paths:
  home:     /
  fundraise:    /fundraise

# (required) Screen widths (and optional height) to resize the browser to before taking the screenshot.
screen_widths:
  - 320
  - 768
  - 1400

# (optional) JavaScript file to execute before taking screenshot of every path. Default: nil
# before_capture: 'javascript/disable_javascript--phantom.js'

# (required) The directory that your screenshots will be stored in
directory: 'shots'

# (required) Amount of fuzz ImageMagick will use when comparing images. A higher fuzz makes the comparison less strict.

# (optional) Choose which results are displayed in the gallery, and in what order. Default: alphanumeric
# Options:
#   alphanumeric - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by path
#   diffs_first - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
#   diffs_only - only paths with a difference are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
# Note: different screen widths are always grouped together.
mode: diffs_first
