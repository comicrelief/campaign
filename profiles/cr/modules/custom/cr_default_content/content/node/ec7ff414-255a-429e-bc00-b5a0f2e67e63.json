It's been great having some guests come up and see me though, it'll be so nice having Grimmy and Example with me today. Even though my body is saying \u2018please stop\u2019, there is no way I'm giving in. I'm in the zone, even if my legs are not. I think they might still be in Belfast. I'm hanging on by a thread. I really need everyone's help and support to get through the next two days.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>With his leg muscles seizing up from fatigue and the biting cold, and his feet strapped into his pedals, Greg struggled to keep his balance on the bike and took a fall at the side of the road. Fortunately, he was unharmed and was on his way again in seconds.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>His cycle was followed by an indoor swim, when he was joined by singer Example. He then ran through Sheffield city centre to the radio studio where he presented his afternoon show. Luckily he had fellow Radio 1 DJ and presenter Nick Grimshaw to cheer him along.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>BBC Radio 1\u2019s Gregathlon for Sport Relief will see Greg attempt to run, swim and cycle a triathlon a day for five consecutive days, across five UK cities. Tomorrow Greg will attempt to complete his final triathlon in Norwich.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money raised from the challenge will be spent helping people living unimaginably tough lives, with half of the money raised used to make a difference right here in the UK. The other half is used to transform lives across the world\u2019s poorest communities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greg needs your support to keep him going as he takes on his Gregathlon. You can sponsor him&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sportrelief.com\/sponsorgreg\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by Greg?
