Please indicate your preference to either receive a replacement item or a refund. If you have indicated a preference for a refund and we find that the goods are faulty, and you have returned them within a reasonable period, we will refund the purchase price to you (including the original postage and packing we charged you), and your postage and packaging costs for returning the goods (standard recorded delivery).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note that due to campaign time constraints and stock availability, we cannot guarantee that any replacement items will be received in time for Red Nose Day on 24 March 2017.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Exchanges<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately due to our short selling period, we are unable to process exchanges, except in the case of incorrect items being delivered or faulty goods.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Returns Address<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Please use the returns label included in the delivery note.
