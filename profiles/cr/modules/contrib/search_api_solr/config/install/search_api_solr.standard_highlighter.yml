# Specifies a text snippet generator for highlighted text. The standard
# fragmenter is gap, which creates fixed-sized fragments with gaps for
# multi-valued fields. Another option is regex, which tries to create fragments
# that resemble a specified regular expression. This parameter accepts per-field
# overrides.
fragmenter: gap
# If set to true, Solr will highlight phrase queries (and other advanced
# position-sensitive queries) accurately. If false, the parts of the phrase will
# be highlighted everywhere instead of only when it forms the given phrase.
usePhraseHighlighter: true
# If set to true, Solr will highlight wildcard queries (and other MultiTermQuery
# subclasses). If false, they won't be highlighted at all.
highlightMultiTerm: true
# If true, multi-valued fields will return all values in the order they were
# saved in the index. If false, only values that match the highlight request
# will be returned.
preserveMulti: false
regex:
  # When using the regex fragmenter (hl.fragmenter=regex), this parameter defines
  # the factor by which the fragmenter can stray from the ideal fragment size
  # (given by hl.fragsize) to accommodate a regular expression. For instance, a
  # slop of 0.2 with hl.fragsize=100 should yield fragments between 80 and 120
  # characters in length. It is usually good to provide a slightly smaller
  # hl.fragsize value when using the regex fragmenter.
  slop: 0.5
  # Specifies the regular expression for fragmenting. This could be used to
  # extract sentences.
  pattern: blank
  # Instructs Solr to analyze only this many characters from a field when using
  # the regex fragmenter (after which, the fragmenter produces fixed-sized
  # fragments). Applying a complicated regex to a huge field is computationally
  # expensive.
