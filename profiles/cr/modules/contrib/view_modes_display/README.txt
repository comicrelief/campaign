View Modes Display previews view modes for your entities.

When working on a site with many content types and view modes for example, it becomes
tedious to find out where to view the rendered entity in a given view mode. This helper module
aims to solve this by providing an additional tab "Preview Display" on the node itself.

On the "Preview Display" all view modes with custom settings will be rendered in the
enabled theme.

A contextual link is also added to make it easy to link to the "Preview Display" tab.

This module is compatible with both Entity View modes (entity_view_mode) and Display Suite (ds).

--CONFIGURATION --

No configuration is needed, enable the module and check for the "Preview Display" tab
on any node page.

-- CUSTOM ENTITIES --

At this moment, the following entity types are supported:

- node
- block
- user

Support for custom entities is planned, and patches are welcome!
