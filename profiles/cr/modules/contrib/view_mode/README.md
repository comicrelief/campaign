INTRODUCTION

View mode provides a field type to store view modes.

This can be used to allow users to pick from a set of preselected view modes, and is best integrated with Display Suite or to provide custom logic based on user-selected view modes.

This provides an alternative to storing view modes in an options field that cannot be changed after the field contains data.

## Wishlist

* Allow to select view modes from other entity types than the entity type the view mode field is part of
* Allow to configure this field to connect with an entityreference field, and allow to preview that entityreference field using the selected view mode.
* Provide a field formatter to make this field render the referenced entityreference field in the selected view mode.
