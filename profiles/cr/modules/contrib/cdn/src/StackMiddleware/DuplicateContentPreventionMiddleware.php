/**
 * Redirects CDN user agents' requests for HTML to the canonical location.
 *
 * Prevents the CDN from returning content (HTML pages). We only want the CDN to
 * serve files like images, CSS, JavaScript, et cetera. Without this, it will
 * return anything.
 *
 * This prevents that infamous "duplicate content" SEO problem by redirecting
 * when appropriate.
 *
 * Of course, the web servers will only execute Drupal for URLs
 * that don't have a file on disk. So this code is only executed for actual
 * responses Drupal needs to send â€¦ but also for generated files, such as
 * image styles.
 * So, this code assumes that URLs without file extensions (or HTML-like file
 * extensions) is for HTML responses. Anything else is assumed to be for
 * generated files, such as image styles.
 *
 * However, a consequence of this is that if your site is behind a reverse proxy
 * (such as Varnish) that indiscriminately caches responses for anonymous users,
 * that your reverse proxy will end up serving responses intended only for CDN
 * user agents to non-CDN user agents. Consequently, your end users will be
 * stuck in an endless redirect loop.
 *
 * Ideally, the CDN module would cause Drupal 8 to send a 'Vary: User-Agent'
 * response header for every response. But since that means caching thousands of
 * variations, it implies it would be effectively disabling caching in the
 * reverse proxy, which is undesirable. There we have to choose between two
 * strategies:
 * 1. Duplicate the logic of this class for the reverse proxy.
 * 2. Ensure that responses to requests made by the CDN user agent are cached
 *    *separately* by the reverse proxy. This effectively implements a very
 *    limited 'Vary: User-Agent'. (In other words: let your reverse proxy
 *    normalize the 'User-Agent' header into two categories: CDN user agent and
 *    everything else. Then use this normalized value as a key for looking up
 *    cached responses.)
 *
 * You may wonder why this doesn't impact Drupal's built-in Page Cache. Well,
 * this middleware runs *before* the Page Cache. So it's effectively identical
 * to strategy 1.
