/**
 * Describes the capacity tracker.
 *
 * The capacity tracker is the central orchestrator between limited system
 * resources and a never-ending queue of cache invalidation items.
 *
 * The tracker actively tracks how much items are invalidated during Drupal's
 * request lifetime and how much PHP execution time has been spent. With this
 * information it can predict how much processing can happen during the rest of
 * request lifetime. It is able to predict this since the capacity tracker also
 * collects timing estimates from the actual purgers. The intelligence it has
 * is used by the queue service and exceeding the limit isn't possible as the
 * purgers service refuses to operate when the limits are near zero.
