   * when ran through the command line - these limitations aren't in place. This

   * always be a hard outer limit of how many invalidation objects are being
   * processed during Drupal's request lifetime.
   *

  /**
   * Get the maximum number of seconds, processing a single invalidation takes.
   *
   * Implementations need to return the maximum number of seconds it would take
   * them to process a single invalidation. It is important that this value is
   * not smaller than real code will take to execute, but also not many seconds
   * longer then necessary. If - for instance - your purger relies on external
   * HTTP requests, you can set a reasonable request timeout and also use that
   * as estimate here.
   *
   * General tips:
   *   - The float must stay between 0.1 and 10.00 seconds.
   *   - Always assume that your purger plugin is the only enabled purger.
   *   - Your returning time will be statically cached during request life-time,
   *     so don't return different values during a single request.
   *   - If your purger is able to bundle all invalidations in one action,
   *     try to estimate the smallest fraction of time per object, e.g.: 0.1.
   *   - If your purger executes invalidation in multiple steps (e.g. some CDNs)
   *     that can take many minutes, make sure to keep this value low. Put your
   *     objects into PROCESSING and they return back later to check status
   *     in which you can finalize their status into SUCCEEDED.
   *
   * @warning
   *   Please take implementing this method seriously, as it strongly influences
   *   real-world experiences for end users. Undercutting can result in requests
   *   that time out and too high values can lead to queue-processing not being
   *   able to keep up.
   *
