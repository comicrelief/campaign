   *    measurement will not be saved as it is likely unrepresentative data.
   *
   *  - Measurements slower than previous records take priority. This means that
   *    a single slow (yet successful) performance will relentlessly adjust the
   *    measurement upwards, better safe...
   *
   *  - Every faster measurement than previously stored records leads to 10%
   *    reduction of the last recorded measurement. This means structural low
   *    performance will be rewarded by more capacity, but slow and carefully!
