 * Related classes:
 *
 * - \Drupal\rabbitmq\Connection (this class): a factory for a
 *   \PhpAmqpLib\Connection\AMQPStreamConnection instance
 * - \PhpAmqpLib\Connection\AMQPStreamConnection: the RabbitMQ "connection",
 *   which wraps a BSD socket, handling protocol negotiation and authentication.
 *   It is not generally used as such, but as the base connection on which a
 *   "channel" is allocated. It needs a close() after use, after its channels
 *   have themselves been closed.
 * - \PhpAmqpLib\Channel\Channel: the actual communication tube, allocated on a
 *   given AMQPStreamConnection, on which "queue" insteance are declared and
 *   handled. They are created from the connection and need a close() after use.
 * - \AMQPQueue: a queue similar to the ones expected by the Drupal Queue API.
 * - \PhpAmqpLib\Message; this is the payload published over a queue by
 *   producers, and which consumers receive in their $item->data.
 *
 * This class is not tied with the Drupal Queue API.
