YAML Form
---------


### About this Module

The YAML Form module is a form builder and submission manager for Drupal 8.

The primary use case for this module is to:

- **Build** a new form or duplicate an existing template
- **Publish** the form as a page, node, or block
- **Collect** submissions
- **Send** confirmations and notifications
- **Review** submissions online
- **Download** submissions as a CSV

### Goals

- A comprehensive form and survey building solution for Drupal 8. 
- A stable, maintainable, and tested API for building forms and handling submission.
- A pluggable/extensible API for custom form elements and submission handling. 
 

### Documentation

The YAML Form module's documentation is still under development. The YAML Form 
module has a dedicated website that provides 
a [features summary](http://yamlform.io/features/), 
[installation instructions](http://yamlform.io/support/installation/),
[FAQs](http://yamlform.io/support/faq/),
and [more...](http://yamlform.io/yamlform/).


### Releases

Even though the YAML Form module is still under active development with
regular [beta releases](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/version-info/alpha-beta-rc),
all existing configuration and submission data will be maintained and updated 
between releases.  **APIs can and will be changing** while this module moves 
from beta releases to a final release candidate. 

Simply put, if you install and use the YAML Form module out of the box AS-IS, you _should_ be okay.  Once you start extending forms with plugins, 
altering  hooks, and overriding templates, you will need to read each release's 
notes and assume that _things will be changing_.
