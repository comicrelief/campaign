 INTRODUCTION
 ------------
This module provides a framework for easily creating searches on any entity
known to Drupal, using any kind of search engine. For site administrators,
it is a great alternative to other search solutions, since it already
incorporates faceting support and the ability to use the Views module for
displaying search results, filters, etc. Also, with the Apache Solr
integration, a high-performance search engine is available for this module.
Developers, on the other hand, will be impressed by the large flexibility and
numerous ways of extension the module provides. Hence, the growing number of
additional contrib modules, providing additional functionality or helping users
customize some aspects of the search process.
