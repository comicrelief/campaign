Panelizer
---------
The Panelizer module allows supported entities to be treated as Panels [1],
giving options for different default displays on a per bundle basis. For
example, this allows each node display to be customized individually.


Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Supports Drupal core's included entities - nodes, taxonomy terms, users
  and comments. (More may be available in the future)

* Can be easily extended to support additional entities.


Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CTools v8.x-3.x [2]
Panels v8.x-3.x
