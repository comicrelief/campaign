# Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)

## Requirements

* [AMP Theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/amptheme)
* [AMP PHP Library](https://github.com/Lullabot/amp-library)


## Introduction

The AMP module is designed to convert Drupal pages into pages that comply with the AMP standard . Initially only node pages will be converted. Other kinds of pages will be enabled at a later time.

When the AMP module is installed, AMP can be enabled for any node type. At that point, a new AMP view mode is created for that content type, and AMP content becomes available on URLs such as node/1?amp or node/article-title?amp. We also created special AMP formatters for text, image, and video fields.

The [AMP Theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/amptheme) is designed to produce the very specific markup that the AMP HTML standard requires. The AMP theme is triggered for any node delivered on an ?amp path. As with any Drupal theme, the AMP theme can be extended using a subtheme, allowing publishers as much flexibility as they need to customize how AMP pages are displayed. This also makes it possible to do things like place AMP ad blocks on the AMP page using Drupal's block system.

The [AMP PHP Library](https://github.com/Lullabot/amp-library) analyzes HTML entered by users into rich text fields and reports issues that might make the HTML non-compliant with the AMP standard.  The library does its best to make corrections to the HTML, where possible, and automatically converts images and iframes into their AMP HTML equivalents. More automatic conversions will be available in the future. The PHP Library is CMS agnostic, designed so that it can be used by both the Drupal 8 and Drupal 7 versions of the Drupal module, as well as by non-Drupal PHP projects.

We have done our best to make this solution as turnkey as possible, but the module, in its current state, is not feature complete. At this point only node pages can be converted to AMP HTML. The initial module supports AMP HTML tags such as amp-ad, amp-pixel, amp-img, amp-video, amp-analytics, and amp-iframe, but we plan to add support for more of the extended components in the near future. For now the module supports Google Analytics, AdSense, and DoubleClick
for Publisher ad networks, but additional network support is forthcoming.

## Module Architecture Overview

The module will be responsible for the basic functionality of providing an AMP version of Drupal pages. It will:

- Create an AMP view mode, so users can identify which fields in which order should be displayed on the AMP version of a page.
- Create an AMP route, which will display the AMP view mode on an AMP path (i.e. node/1?amp).
- Create AMP formatters for common fields, like text, image, video, and iframe that can be used in the AMP view mode to display AMP-compatible markup for those fields.
- Create AMP ad blocks that can be placed by the theme.
- The theme can place AMP pixel items in the page markup where appropriate, based on the configuration options.
- Create an AMP configuration page where users can identify which ad and analytics systems to use, and identify which theme is the AMP theme.
- Create a way for users to identify which content types should provide AMP pages, and a way to override individual nodes to prevent them from being displayed as AMP pages (to use for odd pages that wouldnâ€™t transform correctly).
- Make sure that paths that should not work as AMP pages generate 404s instead of broken pages.
- Make sure that aliased paths work correctly, so if node/1 has an alias of my-page, node/1?amp has an alias of my-page?amp.
- Create a system so the user can preview the AMP page.

The body field presents a special problem, since it is likely to contain lots of invalid markup, especially embedded images, videos, tweets, and iframes. There is no easy way to convert a blob of text with invalid markup into AMP-compatible markup. At the same time, this is a common problem that other projects will run into. Our solution is to create a separate, stand-alone, [AMP PHP Library](https://github.com/Lullabot/amp-library) to transform that markup, as best it can, from non-compliant HTML to AMP HTML. The AMP formatter for the body will use that library to render the body in the AMP view mode.
