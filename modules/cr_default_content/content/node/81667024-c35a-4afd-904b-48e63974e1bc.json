You\u2019ll have to keep listening to BBC Radio 1 to find out! The duo will take-over Radio 1 airwaves as they broadcast a specially extended show from 4pm onwards. Radio 1 listeners will be powering the LOL-a-thon as they send in their favourite jokes for Scott and Chris to read out across the 24 hours. The duo will be helped in their endeavours by fellow Radio 1 presenters as well as special guests, who will be stopping by to read out jokes and prolong the Lols.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>They\u2019re both feeling incredibly inspired having recently visited Depaul, a leading youth homelessness charity who provide accommodation and skills services, to learn about the issues young people face trying to move forward in their lives and how Comic Relief funding is helping. They will be encouraging their listeners to keep them going and raise much needed cash this Red Nose Day by sponsoring them for just \u00a33.<\/p>\r\n",
