To ensure Sara feels the power of love and gets the support she needs, Radio 2 shows will be backing her all the way, showing a little respect by playing 80s music and checking in on her every step she takes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her celebrity pals will also jump in to keep her motivated throughout, when her muscles will no doubt ache like never before.<\/p>\r\n",
