He will complete his triathlon with a run past Belfast\u2019s iconic sites, which include the old historic shipyard where the Titanic was built and launched, Stormont Castle and Belfast City Hall.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greg will be attempting to complete over 50 miles and with rain forecast, he faces a soggy start to his challenge.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cI feel like jelly,\u201d he said, before beginning his swim. \u201cI feel really sick but I'm so excited. To quote The Weeknd: \u2018I can't feel my face\u2019 - it's so cold.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThis challenge is going to be difficult, but I've trained really hard for this and I can't wait to get going. Seeing everyone's posts on social tags has been really encouraging, so thank you. I'm going to do the best I can, make it entertaining along the way and hopefully raise lots of cash for Sport Relief.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also received a good luck message from Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin and The Saturdays\u2019 Mollie King will be cheering him on towards the end of the day as he aims to cross the finish line to make it to his Radio 1 show at 4pm.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money raised from the Gregathlon will be spent helping people living unimaginably tough lives, with half of the money raised used to make a difference right here in the UK. The other half is used to transform lives across the world\u2019s poorest communities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January Greg travelled to Jordan to meet displaced families living in desperate conditions. He visited a nursery within the Azraq refugee camp and saw how Comic Relief funding is helping to give young children back their childhoods. The money raised through Sport Relief could help more children like these get a vital education, and support their families to maintain a crucial sense of community.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greg needs your support to keep him going as he takes on his Gregathlon. You can sponsor him here: <a class=\"link--inline-red\" href=\"\/SponsorGreg\">sportrelief.com\/SponsorGreg<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by Greg?
