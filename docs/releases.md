## Release management

Releases are automatically created for every merge into the master branch. If no release type is defined in the commit 
message, then the commit will default to being a `patch` release.

Release types should be defined in the initial line of the commit message as either a `patch`, `minor` or `major` 
release.

For reference please refer to the pull request template.
