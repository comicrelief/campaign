## Updating modules

All Drupal modules, themes, libraries are defined in [drupal-org.make.yml](profiles/cr/drupal-org.make.yml).

The Drupal core version, including possible patches, is defined in [drupal-org-core.make.yml](profiles/cr/drupal-org.make.yml).

### How to update a module?

Whenever you want to update a module to a newer version, you need to follow a series of steps.

First of all, make sure you are using a *clean database*, so run `phing build` before you start the process.

Then, change the version of the module in the makefile, e.g.

	  metatag:
    	version: 1.1

Make sure to also read the release notes of the new module, so you can be sure to be prepared for any drastic updates.

#### Test upgrade path

You can commit this now to the feature branch you are working on. Next, you need to rebuild the codebase to use the newer version

	phing make

You now need to test the *upgrade path* from the old to the new version, so run the update process via drush, like

	drush updatedb

	The following updates are pending:
	metatag module :
		8002 -   ...

If all is fine, you need to test that the upgrade path worked, first by running our automated test suite, like

	phing test

and then also make a series of manual tests, that specifically involve the module that you just updated. In our case, we might want to test the metatags on the different pages.

#### Test clean install

We also need to test a clean install with our new module. So, rebuild the site

	phing build

and do the same series of testing (manual and automated)

	phing test

#### Test upgrade path in sites like RND17

For the more complex upgrades (e.g. an important upgrade to paragraphs), it is advised to also test this in sites that implement the `campaign` profile, such as RND17. 

To test this, you need to [follow RND17 instructions](https://github.com/comicrelief/rnd17#updating-the-base-profile) on how to implement an upgrade of the profile.

Don't forget to change the base branch of [rnd17.make.yml](https://github.com/comicrelief/rnd17/blob/develop/profiles/rnd17/rnd17.make.yml) to use your feature branch, like

	projects:
 	cr:
 		type: profile
 			download:
 				branch: feature/XXX_MY_MODULE_UPDATE
 				url: git@github.com:comicrelief/campaign.git
