# Comic Relief Campaign website

A work in progress. See http://confluence.comicrelief.com/display/RND17/Campaign+platform+notes

## How to set this up locally

## FrontEnd set up

###Install npm. https://docs.npmjs.com/

In the theme directory run:

	npm install

###Install bundler. http://bundler.io/

In the theme directory run:

	bundle install

Bundler will install all gems needed for your project.

###Grunt dev / build

For dev run:

	grunt default

Grunt will watch all SASS / TWIG / JS / Images for changes

And,

- Compile CSS
- jshint JS
- Generate compass image sprites
- Add source sass map to help inspect sass files in browser inspector
- Reload your browser (you need livereload chrome extension)

For prod run:

	grunt build

Grunt will compile CSS, remove comments, remove sass source file, minify and concatenate js.

### Install and configure Drush 8

Drush 8 is required for Drupal 8. Install instructions can be found [here](http://x-team.com/2015/02/install-drush-8-drupal-8-without-throwing-away-drush-6-7/).

Or use `composer global require drush/drush` and you'll use the last version.
If you want to use drush 6 again `composer global require drush/drush 6.*`


### Install Phing

You first will need to install to install [Phing](www.phing.info), which is a PHP build tool that automates tasks such as re-installing the site, running migrate procedures, tests etc.

Download Phing from http://www.phing.info/trac/wiki/Users/Download and follow installation instructions. The preferred way is to install this using PEAR.

Or use `composer global require phing/phing` [guide](https://coderwall.com/p/ma_cuq/using-composer-to-manage-global-packages)

### Configure Phing

Copy over `build.example.properties` to `build.properties`

	cp build.example.properties build.properties

And now adapt `build.properties` adding in your Drush 8 binary location, database connection details, and your local website URL.

Now, do the same with `settings.local.php`

	cp sites/default/settings.example.local.php sites/default/settings.local.php

And change the database connection details as well.

### Using Phing

To install the site, now run

	phing build

Note: If you see the following exception on `phing build`:

`Exception 'Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Exception\InvalidArgumentException' with message 'The service definition "renderer" does not exist.`

...change the host value in settings.local.php from `'host' => 'localhost',` to `'host' => '127.0.0.1',`.

To login to the site, for example run

	phing login

To remake all contrib modules (for example, when adding a new module), run

	phing make

To list all possible Phing targets, check

	phing -l

## How to run this on Pantheon

Add Pantheon as a second remote

	git remote add pantheon ssh://codeserver.dev.f9291f1f-3819-4964-9c5b-c9f7d5500d28@codeserver.dev.f9291f1f-3819-4964-9c5b-c9f7d5500d28.drush.in:2222/~/repository.git

Now you can push to Pantheon to deploy this
